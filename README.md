# bankApp

Maven simple console bank application for my studies with support JDBC database on the Glasfish server. 
I implemented logback, slf4j and jUnit libraries. 

!jUnit tests in progress

To create database:
+ Database name: bankDB
+ User: Zawadzki
+ Password: password;

(You can create your own database but then you have to change ConnectionFactory class)

To create tables run:

start_script.sql
